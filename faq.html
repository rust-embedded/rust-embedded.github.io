<h2 id="long-answer"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#long-answer">§</a>1.2 Long answer</h2>
<p>We can talk about support at different levels: does the compiler support my
device? does the crate ecosystem support my device?</p>
<p>Let’s start with compiler support. The compiler supports architectures or ISA
(Instruction Set Architectures) rather than specific devices. Compiler support
can be further divided in two levels: compilation target support and
architecture support.</p>
<h3 id="compilation-target-support"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#compilation-target-support">§</a>1.2.1 Compilation target support</h3>
<p>By compilation target support we mean that you can readily cross compile a crate
for a certain <em>compilation target</em> using Cargo. To keep the default installation
slim only the native compilation target is installed and other targets have to
be installed using the <code>rustup target</code> subcommand. If <code>rustup target list</code> lists
a compilation target that matches your device then Cargo supports cross
compiling to your device.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to know if <code>rustc</code> supports cross compiling to
32-bit RISCV. We check <code>rustup target list</code></p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-console"><code>$ rustup default 1.29.0
$ rustup target list | grep -i riscv || echo not supported
not supported

$ rustup default nightly-2018-09-18 # this date is just an example
$ rustc -V
rustc 1.30.0-nightly (2224a42c3 2018-09-17)
$ rustup target list | grep -i riscv || echo not supported
riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf</code></pre></div>
<p>This indicates that 1.29 doesn’t support 32-bit RISCV but that 1.30 will.</p>
<p>Once you have installed a compilation target using <code>rustup target add $T</code> you’ll
be able to cross compile crates to it using <code>cargo build --target $T</code>.</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-console"><code>$ rustup target add riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
$ cargo build --target riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf</code></pre></div><h3 id="architecture-support"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#architecture-support">§</a>1.2.2 Architecture support</h3>
<p>If your device doesn’t appear in <code>rustup target list</code> that doesn’t mean that
<code>rustc</code> doesn’t support your device at all. It could still support code
generation for your device <em>architecture</em>. <code>rustc</code> uses LLVM to generate machine
code; if the LLVM backend for your device architecture is enabled in <code>rustc</code>
then <code>rustc</code> can produce assembly and/or object files for that architecture.</p>
<p>The easiest way to list the architectures that LLVM supports is to run
<code>cargo objdump -- -version</code> where <code>cargo-objdump</code> is one of <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo-binutils</code></a>
subcommands.</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-console"><code>$ rustup default nightly-2018-09-18 # this date is just an example

<p>If your device architecture is not there that means <code>rustc</code> doesn’t support your
device. It could be that LLVM doesn’t support the architecture (e.g. Xtensa,
ESP8266’s architecture) or that LLVM’s support for the architecture is not
considered stable enough and has not been enabled in <code>rustc</code> (e.g. AVR, the
architecture most commonly found in Arduino microcontrollers).</p>
<p>If your device architecture is there then that means that, in principle, <code>rustc</code>
supports your device. However, an architecture like ARM can be very broad
covering several ISAs and extensions. Instead, you’ll want to work with a
compilation target tailored to your device. Custom compilation targets are out
of scope for this document; you should refer to the <a href="https://rust-embedded.github.io/embedonomicon/compiler-support.html">embedonomicon</a> for more
information.</p>
<h3 id="crate-ecosystem-support"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#crate-ecosystem-support">§</a>1.2.3 Crate ecosystem support</h3>
<p>Crate ecosystem support can range from generic support for the architecture to
device-specific support. We recommend that you search on crates.io for the
architecture (e.g. ARM or Cortex-M), for the microcontroller vendor (e.g.
STM32), for the target device (e.g. STM32F103) and the target development board
(e.g. STM32F3DISCOVERY). We also suggest that you check the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust">awesome-embedded-rust</a> list and <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg#organization">the crates maintained by the embedded Working
Group</a>.</p>
<h1 id="when-will-rust-support-the-avr-architecture"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#when-will-rust-support-the-avr-architecture">§</a>2 (When) will Rust support the AVR architecture?</h1>
<p>As of 2020-07-24 the support for AVR have been merged into the nightly version of
the official Rust compiler, <code>rustc</code>. See the RFC for merging the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44052#issuecomment-663394401%5D.">avr-rust fork</a>.</p>
<h1 id="when-will-rust-support-the-xtensa-architecture"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#when-will-rust-support-the-xtensa-architecture">§</a>3 (When) will Rust support the Xtensa architecture?</h1>
<p>As of 2020-08-24 the official Rust compiler, <code>rustc</code>, relies on LLVM for
generating machine code. It’s a requirement that LLVM supports an architecture
for <code>rustc</code> to support it.</p>
<p>There is no support for the Xtensa architecture in LLVM proper. You may be able
to find several forks of LLVM with varying levels of support for the Xtensa
architecture but <code>rustc</code> will not be able to use any of those forks due to the
maintenance and infrastructure costs of developing <code>rustc</code> against different
versions of LLVM.</p>
<p>TL;DR <code>rustc</code> will support the Xtensa architecture when the official LLVM gains
support for the Xtensa architecture. As LLVM is a project independent of the
Rust project we can’t give you any estimate on when that might happen. A list of
submitted patches can be found on this <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/W486">LLVM dashboard</a>.</p>
<h1 id="my-embedded-rust-program-is-too-big"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#my-embedded-rust-program-is-too-big">§</a>4 My embedded Rust program is too big!</h1>
<p>We sometimes get questions like this one: “My Rust program is 500 KB but my
microcontroller only has 16 KB of Flash; how can I make it fit?”.</p>
<p>The first thing to confirm is that correctly measuring the size of your program.
<code>rustc</code> produces ELF files for most embedded targets. ELF files have metadata
and contain debug information so measuring their size on disk with e.g. <code>ls -l</code>
will give you the wrong number.</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-console"><code>$ # 500 KB?
$ ls -hl target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app
-rwxr-xr-x 2 japaric japaric 554K Sep 19 13:37 target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/debug/app</code></pre></div>
<p>The correct way to measure the size of an embedded program is to use the <code>size</code>
program or the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo size</code></a> subcommand.</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-console"><code>$ # ~ 2 KB of Flash
$ cargo size --bin app -- -A

<p>Of the standard sections, <code>.vector_table</code>, <code>.text</code>, <code>.rodata</code> and <code>.data</code> will
occupy Flash / ROM; <code>.bss</code> and <code>.data</code> will occupy RAM; <code>.debug_*</code>,
<code>.ARM.attributes</code> and <code>.comments</code> can be ignored as they won’t be loaded into
the target device memory. (<code>.data</code> is initially placed in
Flash / ROM, but copied to RAM during startup to make it writable.) For the other sections you’ll have to check your
dependencies’ docs.</p>
<p>In this example the uploaded software will occupy <code>2008</code> bytes of Flash.</p>
<p>Note that most (all?) runtime crates, like <code>cortex-m-rt</code>, will check at link
time that the program fits in the target device memory. If it doesn’t fit you’ll
get a linker error and no output binary. So, provided that you correctly entered
the size of the memory regions of your device then if it links it should fit in
the target device!</p>
<p>If you are measuring size using the right method and your program is still too
big then check out our section on optimizations.</p>

<p>It is quite common that by oversight the linker configuration is not suitable
for the target device. Indications for such a problem are loading errors in <code>gdb</code>:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code>(gdb) load
Loading section .vector_table, size <span class="number">0x400 </span>lma <span class="number">0x0
</span>Loading section .text, size <span class="number">0x2064 </span>lma <span class="number">0x400
</span>Load failed</code></pre></div>
<p>Please note the <code>lma</code> which is the loading address and needs to match up with the
start address of the flash.</p>
<p>Similarly <code>openocd</code> will indicate such a problem:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code>...

<p>If you see such a message you will need to check your linker configuration, usually in
<code>memory.x</code> for the correct addresses (and ideally also sizes). Please also note that
after a change you will need to <code>cargo clean</code> and rebuild to use the changed addresses.</p>
<h1 id="my-program-just-halts-without-connected-debugger-what-am-i-doing-wrong"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#my-program-just-halts-without-connected-debugger-what-am-i-doing-wrong">§</a>6 My program just halts without connected debugger. What am I doing wrong?</h1><h2 id="short-answer-1"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#short-answer-1">§</a>6.1 Short answer</h2>
<p>If you’re using <code>semihosting</code>, switch to a different input / output mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="long-answer-1"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#long-answer-1">§</a>6.2 Long answer</h2>
<p>An embedded MCU will typically stop  working if exceptions (which is the MCUs way
of signalling special or abnormal events) occur which are not handled and cleared,
either by an exception handler or a connected debugger. The latter case is especially
interesting because there’s a method of interacting with a connected computer
dubbed <code>semihosting</code> which will work iff a debugger is properly connected
and debugging software running and correctly set up. This method uses special
processor instructions (e.g. a service or breakpoint call) to alert the connected
system about input and/or output requests from the device. If no debugger is
available to handle such a situation, the system either wait indefinitely or
generate an even stronger exception which can only be cleared by a reset.</p>
<p>There’re two common scenarios which cause such a lockup unintentionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of semihosting as input / output channel, e.g. via <code>cortex-m-semihosting</code> crate</li>
<li>A <code>panic</code> in the program with the <code>panic-semihosting</code> crate in use, however the
occurence of a <code>panic</code> means that the program is defunct anyway</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that examples may make use of the <code>semihosting</code> concept but this
should not be used in production setups due to the lack of connected debugger and
a host running appropriate debugging software. The use of a serial interface is
often a better choice. However if you just would like to see your example running
please make sure your setup is ready to deal with the <code>semihosting</code> requirements.</p>
